# RTS

(I'll come up with a name later)

This is my Capstone Project at Neumont: College of Computer Science. 
_ is a vision I've had for a few years, which is a combination of the XCOM series' mission based gameplay with Men of War's infantry management.
The game will have the player proceed throughout missions with their squad to complete objectives.
I am currently planning only 1 mission, maybe 2 for the end of my capstone quarter, since I do not know how 1 mission would go yet.

Developed with Unreal Engine 5
